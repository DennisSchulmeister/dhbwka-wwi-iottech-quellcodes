	  Dlib is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning
	  algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++
	  to solve real world problems. It is used in both industry
	  and academia in a wide range of domains including robotics,
	  embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance
	  computing environments. Dlib's open source licensing allows
	  you to use it in any application, free of charge.
	  
	  NOTE: This is the python version of dlib, which statically
	  links against libdlib, as per upstream. If you also need
	  the C++ library itself you need to enable libdlib, too.
